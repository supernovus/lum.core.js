# lum.core.js

Some small *core* constants, functions, classes, and objects.
Things that make working with objects in Javascript slightly nicer,
and work in CommonJS/Node.js and modern browsers without any modifications.

Used by all the rest of my *Lum.js* libraries.

## Exports

TODO: a brief summary of the exports.
