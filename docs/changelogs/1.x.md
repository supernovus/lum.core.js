# Changelog â†’ 1.x

This is the changelog for the `1.x` versions.

See [Changelogs](index.md) for more information on the changelogs.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2022-09-27
### Changed
- Updated a few DocBlocks.
- Added a couple explicitly named options to `def()`
- Rewrote the default module to use `def()` to define its exported properties.
- Made `arrays`, `strings`, `flags`, `opt`, `modules`, and `observable` use `lazy()`.
### Fixed
- Fixed `def()` so that the descriptor defaults are applied properly.
- Fixed `lazy()` so it returns a proper value and not a descriptor on first access.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-26
### Changed
- Moved `lazy` into `types` module by default (leaving an alias in `core`).
- Completely rewrote the `lazy` function entirely.
- Greatly extended the documentation for `lazy` function.
- Removed an unused development artefact from `types.needs`.

## [1.3.1] - 2022-09-23
### Fixed
- The `arrays` module exports `powerset` and `random` as it should.
- Recursive dependency order issues with `clone`, `lock`, and `enum` resolved.
- Custom `lock` options in `enum` module actually work now.
### Changed
- The `Enum()` function now has `configurable` and `enumerable` options.
- The `configurable` property in `enums` defaults to `false` now.
- Tweaked the *changelogs* a bit and added a new [changelog listing](index.md).

## [1.3.0] - 2022-09-11
### Changed
- Overhauled the `obj.clone()` method.
- Added *named options* for all of the behaviours that the `CLONE` *modes* affect.
  While this technically could make the *modes* obsolete, I'm leaving them in as
  simple sets of default options that can be used instead of manually choosing all
  of the individual options.
- Added a new `CLONE.N` *mode* which has **no** options turned on.
  It will always remain first in the *enum* list so it's value will always be `0`.
- Added the ability to clone properties using their descriptors.
  It is enabled by default on most of the *modes* now, as it simply makes sense.
- Added the ability to set the `prototype` on the cloned object.
- The `opts` parameter of `clone()` may be a `CLONE.*` enum value.
  It's a shortcut for `{mode: CLONE.MODE}` for convenience.
- A small tweak to `obj.copyProps()`, not important, just a cleanup.
### Fixed
- A reference in the DocBlock for `obj.getProperty()`.

## [1.2.1] - 2022-09-05
### Added
- `core.InternalObjectId#untag()`
### Changed
- Cleaned up the wording in a docblock, and updated a test to use `done()`.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-08-10
### Added
- Moved the `array.powerset()` and `array.random()` methods from Lum.js v4 into `core.arrays`.
- Added a new `core.context.isCommonJS()` method which is only used in certain circumstances.

### Fixed 
- A typo in one of the `package.json` exports.
- Commented out a debugging line.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-08-02
### Fixed
- A couple missing constants in some functions.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-07-29
### Added
- `types.doesDescriptorTemplate()` method.
- `obj.getProperty()` method (used to be in the `descriptors` sub-module.)
### Changed
- Tweaked documentation for:
  - `obj.getObjectPath()`
  - `obj.setObjectPath()`
  - `obj.getNamespace()`
  - `obj.setNamespace()`
- Updated error messages in `obj.setObjectPath()`
- Made `obj.setObjectPath()` use `types.doesDescriptorTemplate()` for validation of `opts.desc` option.
- Changed `obj.getObjectPath()` and `obj.setObjectPath()` to support `function` parent objects.
- Enhanced `types.stringify()` to support `RegExp` as well as supporting custom extensions down the road.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-07-27
### Changed
- Initial *stable* release.
- See [1.0-beta.md](1.0-beta.md) for the beta versions of `1.0`
- See [lum.js](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.js) for the original library set this is replacing.
