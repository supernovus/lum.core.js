## [Unreleased]

## [1.16.0] - 2023-06-08
### Added
- `core.obj.apply`: apply functions or set properties on an object.
- `core.obj.copyProps.cache`: Cached `core.obj~CopyProps` instances.
  - Versions of `cp.into()` and `cp.from()` that cache the instances.
  - `cp.cache.into(target)`: Get an instance for a single `target`.
  - `cp.cache.from(source)`: Get an instance for a single `source`.
- `core.types.TYPES.SET`: A type test for `Set` objects.
### Changed
- `core.obj~CopyProps#set`:
  - Supports setting multiple options by passing an `object`.
- `core.types.console`:
  - Now supports _per-method_ handlers; with an optional `DEFAULT` fallback.
  - New `methodArg` option for passing method name to `function` handlers.
  - New `msgArguments` option for including `arguments` _object_ in log.
  - New `msgArgs` option for including `args` _array_ in log.
  - The global options can be overridden by properties defined in:
    - A _per-method_ definition object.
    - An individual `function` or `Array` handler.
## [1.15.0] - 2023-06-07
### Added
- `core.arrays.List` class to abstract different types of lists.
### Changed
- `core.arrays.{containsAny,containsAll,removeItems}` use the new `List` class.
- Removed the enumerable prop from the `core.*` exports.
### Fixed
- `arrays.removeItems` was only removing the first instance of a value.

## [1.14.0] - 2023-05-18
### Changed
- Made the `core.context` more robust.
  - Greatly expanded Node.js detection with new `Node` property.
  - Added a new `Electron` property for detection of Electron.js environments.
  - Minor tweaks to other properties for more completion and accuracy.

## [1.13.0] - 2023-05-12
### Added
- `obj.getMethods()` gets a list of object methods.
  - Recurses through prototype tree.
  - Supports advanced filtering techniques via `MethodFilter` class.
- `obj.MethodFilter` class; mostly used by `getMethods()`.
- `obj.signatureOf()` gets function signatures.

## [1.12.1] - 2023-02-11
### Fixed
- Dependency issues in `clone` and `lock` due to the previous `Enum` changes.
- The `lazy()` function now returns the target, like the docs said it did. 

## [1.12.0] - 2023-02-02
### Changed
- Enhanced the `Enum` generator.
  - The `opts.counter` is always used regardless of `opts.flags`.
  - If `opts.open` is `true`, that will overrule `opts.lock` now.
  - If `opts.lock` is not a valid value, a `TypeError` will be thrown.
  - Actually wrote the docblock for the function.

## [1.11.0] - 2023-01-24
### Changed
- Major overhaul of `observable`
  - `isObservable` property is now a nested object.
  - Added `wrapargs` in addition to `wrapthis`.
  - Added `addre` to add a method to change observable options.
  - Removed legacy `addme` default value when using `wrapthis`.
  - Added `args` to wrapper object.
  - Added a version of `isObservable` to the wrapper object.
  - Wrapper object is now locked (frozen).
  - Use the core type name constants.
  - Rewrote `onEachEvent()`, uses `.split()` instead of `.replace()`
  - Added a `$$observable$$` metadata property for debugging.
### Fixed
- In `observable`, the first event name was not considered `typed` due
  to the old `onEachEvent()` method. That is now fixed.

## [1.10.0] - 2023-01-19
### Fixed
- The `core.opt` lazy loader works properly now.
### Changed
- The `core.context` vars have been changed quite a bit.
  The context now works in more environments, and supports Webpack properly.
- Rearranged `exports` in `package.json` to be in alphabetical order. 
## [1.9.0] - 2023-01-16
### Changed
- The `test` handler configuration.
- Changed `test.output()` to `test.done()` in all tests.
### Added
- New `core.types.console` simple helper object.

## [1.8.2] - 2023-01-06
### Changed
- How the objectid and meta properties are exported to `core`.

## [1.8.1] - 2023-01-06
### Fixed
- Debugging line left in accidently.

## [1.8.0] - 2023-01-06
### Changed
- MAJOR CHANGE: After making everything use ModuleBuilder, I'm deprecating it.
  - It's cool in theory, but doesn't translate well when using webpack, etc.
  - It also locks the libraries into using CommonJS, which I don't want to do.
  - I've moved it into the `@lumjs/compat/modulebuilder` namespace.
  - A `@lumjs/compat/modulebuilder/into-core` helper can add it back to `core`.
- I removed the `core.modules` lazy property.
  - Use `require('@lumjs/core/modules')` to load that library explicitly.
  - This will be the path going forward for any code that is node.js specific.
### Added
- A new descriptor template builder. To be documented soon.
### Fixed
- Added some missing reference links to this changelog.

## [1.7.1] - 2022-10-18
### Fixed
- Corrected some DocBlocks that hadn't been updated.
### Changed
- Made *locale* functionality in `ModuleBuilder` simpler.
- Added some shortcuts for defining module names in `ModuleBuilder`.

## [1.7.0] - 2022-10-17
### Changed
- The `ModuleBuilder.build()` now exports a link to `def()` as well.
- Added `core.newBuilder()` shortcut function that calls `core.ModuleBuilder.new()`.
- Added `core.obj.duplicateOne()` and `core.obj.duplicateAll()` functions,
  also available as `core.obj.copyAll.clone` and `core.obj.copyAll.duplicate`.
- ModuleBuilder uses `duplicateOne` instead of its own cheap `clone` function.
- Added `ModuleBuilder#set` method as a direct `core.def()` wrapper.
- Added `set()` wrapper to `ModuleBuilder.build()` output.
- ModuleBuilder detects accessor-style descriptors and doesn't try wrapping them.
- Significant refactoring of `core/obj/copyprops` module.
  - Fixed several options that weren't handled correctly.
  - Added a new `recursive` mode that can recursively merge nested objects.
  - Added a new `CopyProps` class for calling `copyProps()` with more than one
    source or target object using a declarative syntax.
- Rewrote `core/obj/merge.mergeNested()` method entirely.
  The new version simply wraps the recursive mode of `copyProps()`.
- Gave `needObj()` a secondary API where the `allowFunc` argument is skipped.

## [1.6.1] - 2022-10-13
### Added
- A `core.buildModule()` wrapper function that calls `core.ModuleBuilder.build()`.
### Fixed
- DocBlock with wrong property name.
- Changelog version pointers.

## [1.6.0] - 2022-10-13
### Added
- New `ModuleBuilder` class for defining modules in a really lazy way.
### Changed
- Made `core.obj` and `core.Enum` into lazy-loading properties.
- Made `core` use the new `ModuleBuilder` for defining its properties.

## [1.5.2] - 2022-10-05
### Changed
- Added separate `.npmignore` file.

## [1.5.1] - 2022-09-29
### Changed
- Removed `constructor()` from `AbstractClass`.
- Added `$needs()` to `AbstractClass`.
### Fixed
- `AbstractClass` actually works properly now.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-09-27
### Changed
- Updated a few DocBlocks.
- Added a couple explicitly named options to `def()`
- Rewrote the default module to use `def()` to define its exported properties.
- Made `arrays`, `strings`, `flags`, `opt`, `modules`, and `observable` use `lazy()`.
### Fixed
- Fixed `def()` so that the descriptor defaults are applied properly.
- Fixed `lazy()` so it returns a proper value and not a descriptor on first access.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-26
### Changed
- Moved `lazy` into `types` module by default (leaving an alias in `core`).
- Completely rewrote the `lazy` function entirely.
- Greatly extended the documentation for `lazy` function.
- Removed an unused development artefact from `types.needs`.

## [1.3.1] - 2022-09-23
### Fixed
- The `arrays` module exports `powerset` and `random` as it should.
- Recursive dependency order issues with `clone`, `lock`, and `enum` resolved.
- Custom `lock` options in `enum` module actually work now.
### Changed
- The `Enum()` function now has `configurable` and `enumerable` options.
- The `configurable` property in `enums` defaults to `false` now.
- Tweaked the *changelogs* a bit and added a new [changelog listing](index.md).

## [1.3.0] - 2022-09-11
### Changed
- Overhauled the `obj.clone()` method.
- Added *named options* for all of the behaviours that the `CLONE` *modes* affect.
  While this technically could make the *modes* obsolete, I'm leaving them in as
  simple sets of default options that can be used instead of manually choosing all
  of the individual options.
- Added a new `CLONE.N` *mode* which has **no** options turned on.
  It will always remain first in the *enum* list so it's value will always be `0`.
- Added the ability to clone properties using their descriptors.
  It is enabled by default on most of the *modes* now, as it simply makes sense.
- Added the ability to set the `prototype` on the cloned object.
- The `opts` parameter of `clone()` may be a `CLONE.*` enum value.
  It's a shortcut for `{mode: CLONE.MODE}` for convenience.
- A small tweak to `obj.copyProps()`, not important, just a cleanup.
### Fixed
- A reference in the DocBlock for `obj.getProperty()`.

## [1.2.1] - 2022-09-05
### Added
- `core.InternalObjectId#untag()`
### Changed
- Cleaned up the wording in a docblock, and updated a test to use `done()`.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-08-10
### Added
- Moved the `array.powerset()` and `array.random()` methods from Lum.js v4 into `core.arrays`.
- Added a new `core.context.isCommonJS()` method which is only used in certain circumstances.

### Fixed 
- A typo in one of the `package.json` exports.
- Commented out a debugging line.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-08-02
### Fixed
- A couple missing constants in some functions.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-07-29
### Added
- `types.doesDescriptorTemplate()` method.
- `obj.getProperty()` method (used to be in the `descriptors` sub-module.)
### Changed
- Tweaked documentation for:
  - `obj.getObjectPath()`
  - `obj.setObjectPath()`
  - `obj.getNamespace()`
  - `obj.setNamespace()`
- Updated error messages in `obj.setObjectPath()`
- Made `obj.setObjectPath()` use `types.doesDescriptorTemplate()` for validation of `opts.desc` option.
- Changed `obj.getObjectPath()` and `obj.setObjectPath()` to support `function` parent objects.
- Enhanced `types.stringify()` to support `RegExp` as well as supporting custom extensions down the road.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-07-27
### Changed
- Initial *stable* release.
- See [1.0-beta.md](1.0-beta.md) for the beta versions of `1.0`
- See [lum.js](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.js) for the original library set this is replacing.
