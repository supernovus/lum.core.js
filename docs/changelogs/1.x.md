# Changelog → 1.x

This is the changelog for the `1.x` versions.

See [Changelogs](index.md) for more information on the changelogs.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.35.0] - 2024-10-03
### Added
- Two new tests to the `types/basics` sub-module:
  - `isPlainObject()`
  - `isClassObject()`
- New `traits.ensureConstructor` function.
### Changed
- Original `core.observable` is now `core.observable.orig`
- The `core.observable()` function determines whether to use the
  original implementation or the compatibility wrapper based on
  the arguments passed to it.
- Tweaked the `traits` module to add some optional advanced features.
- Moved some more docblocks from various modules into src/docs.

## [1.34.0] - 2024-10-01
### Added
- `core.events.observable` compatibility wrapper.
### Changed
- A bunch of little updates to `events` module to support the
  new observable compatibility wrapper.
- Rewrote `types.stringify()` entirely, now uses a class,
  and is a lot more robust (handles recursive references, etc.)
- Refactored the tests for `observable` so they also can work with
  the observable compatibility wrapper (which has some subtle differences).
### Fixed
- A crashing bug in `cp.clone()`.

## [1.33.0] - 2024-09-19
### Added
- `core.obj.delObjectPath()` function.
### Fixed
- `core.obj.setObjectPath()` logic fails and unresolved functions.
### Changed
- Moved docblocks from the main index to a separate file.
- Overhauled the `core/state` module I added yesterday, it's much better now.
- `core.deprecated()` uses the state to enable trace-mode now.

## [1.32.0] - 2024-09-18
### Added
- `core/state` module. Needs documenting.
- `events.extend()` function, it's `register()` but returns the target.
### Changed
- `events.Registry` now allows unregistering, and a few other tweaks.

## [1.31.0] - 2024-09-09
### Added
- New `core/obj/cp` module. Provides alternatives to the `obj.copyProps()`
  and `obj.clone()` functions, which I'm planning to phase out in `2.0`.
- New `core/events` module. Will eventually replace `core.observable`,
  likely also in one of the upcoming `2.x` releases.
### Changed
- A couple tweaks to the `core.Enum` library.
- Updated a lot of DocBlocks.
- Overhauled how documentation is generated.
  - Created a new [@lumjs/build] package to help make this easier.

## [1.30.0] - 2024-08-23
### Note
- This is a huge update, and honestly a lot of it could have waited until 
  the `2.0` release, but I wanted to help make a cleaner transition.
- There may be a few patch releases to fix bugs or mark other things
  as deprecated, but this should be the last big `1.x` release.
- Version `2.0` is my next target when I work on this again.
### Changed
- A major overhaul to the `core.def` function, and its `DescriptorTemplate`
  internal class. This introduces whole new APIs, but done so as
  to not break the existing APIs. After ensuring that all the existing
  tests still work, I added tests for the new functionality.
- Updated the `core.console` library to make it easier to use.
  - It can now export itself to the `globalThis.console` to replace the
    native console for the duration of a process, then restore the native
    console when it's finished.
- Updated the `core.Enum` function with a bunch of enhancements.
- Moved `AbstractClass` out of the `meta` module into an `old` module
  which will be removed in the `2.x` branch.
- A bunch of minor refactoring to the `objectid` anonymous module.
- A massive refactoring to the entire `opt` module.
  - It's now split into a bunch of smaller submodules.
  - The `opt/args` submodule is now available as an external export.
  - Moved the `Opts` class into its own package. See the top-level README
    for further details on that change and what will happen in the future.
- A fairly decent overhaul to the `types` module which cleans up its code
  and makes the `types.JS` constants actually _constant_.
  - `types/basic` and `types/def` are now available as external exports.
### Added
- The `deprecated()` function in the `meta` module.
- A new `wrapDepr()` function in the `meta` module which adds a getter 
  property to an object that when accessed calls `deprecated()` with
  a deprecation message, before returning the actual property value.
### Fixed
- A few minor (and a few not-so-minor) bugs.

## [1.26.0] - 2024-07-23
### Added
- `opt.argOpts()` helper function which allows functions to support
  optional positional arguments, and named options at the same time.
- `opt.getPath()` an alternative to `opt.get()` that uses the
  `obj.getObjectPath()` function to handle getting nested properties.
- `opt.Opts.isPath()` static helper function.
- `opt.Opts#_opts()` internal method to normalize options.
- `opt.Opts#find()` method which is basically a version of `#get()`
  that can look for multiple option names/paths, and will return the
  first one that has a defined value.
### Changed
- `obj.ns` has a new `opts.allowFun` option.
- `opt.val()` and `opt.get()` now use `opt.argOpts()` for optional args.
- `opt.Opts#get()` can use either `opt.get()` or `opt.getPath()` depending
  on either an explicit option, or the result of an `isPath()` test.
  Also is now using the `_opts()` method to normalize its options.
### Fixed
- Time-traveling in the CHANGELOG.
- `obj.ns` passing `opts` as a `bool` was broken.
- `opt.Opts#add()` was ignoring the current position due to old
  unused code from original prototype still being in place.
### Note
- Many of these changes were implemented back in May.
  A few have been tweaked a bit since, but I forgot to commit them
  into a new release until late July. Oops!

## [1.25.2] - 2024-05-14
### Added
- One more function to the `traits` module to make it more usable.

## [1.25.1] - 2024-05-13
### Changed
- Before using it in anything, overhauled the new `traits` module,
  as the previous implementation was flawed in several ways.

## [1.25.0] - 2024-05-09
### Added
- `types.isConstructor()` - Checks for a function with a prototype.
- A new `traits` module implementing a pretty basic _traits_ system.

## [1.24.2] - 2024-04-29
### Fixed
- The last patch broke things even more than the bug it fixed.

## [1.24.1] - 2024-04-25
### Fixed
- The test for `core.context.isBrowser` was seriously broken.

## [1.24.0] - 2025-04-22
### Added
- `maps.getSymbolMap()` → Moved from `@lumjs/web-core/utils` module.
- `maps.getSymbolCache()` → A new extension of `getSymbolMap()`.
### Changed
- Deprecated `obj.{copyAll,duplicateOne,duplicateAll}` functions.
- Overhaul of the `types.isa` documentation.
- Renamed a few variables/arguments in `types.isa` and related functions.
- Updated TODO doc to outline plans for a proposed `v2.x` release.
### Fixed
- `types.unbound.remove()` has been broken since `1.0.0-beta.4`, oops!

## [1.23.0] - 2025-04-17
### Added
- `types.isIterable()` test.
- `types.OfTest` class that now powers `isArrayOf()` and its new siblings.
- `types.isListOf()` function that tests any kind of `Iterable` list.
- `types.isMapOf()` function that tests `Map` for valid _keys_ and _values_.
- `types.isObjOf()` function that tests _plain objects_ enumerable properties.
- `types.OfTest.Rules` class that may be used by `isObjOf()` to differenciate 
  explicit optional _rules_ from implicit object _values_.
- `types.isObjOf.rules()` returns `new types.OfTest.Rules(...arguments)`.
- `obj.flipKeyVal()` flip keys and values in a plain `object`.
- `obj.flipMap()` flip keys and values in a `Map`.
- `obj.flip()` call `flipMap()` for `Map` instances or `flipKeyVal()` otherwise.
### Changed
- `types.isArrayOf()` was rewritten to use the new `OfTest` class.
### Fixed
- `console` sub-module is now exported in `package.json:exports`.

## [1.22.0] - 2025-04-12
### Added
- A new `UniqueObjectIds` class, defined alongside `randomNumber`.
- A new `AbstractError` error class, defined in `meta` sub-module.
### Changed
- Deprecated the `types.instanceOf()` function.
  - Will be removed entirely in the future.
- Tweaked the `isa()` function a bit.
  - Changed the default value of the `instanceof` option to `true`.
  - Will remove `instanceof` entirely in a future release.
  - Removed the `typeof` option entirely; it was useless.
- Deprecated the `AbstractClass` class, defined in `meta` sub-module.
  - It is badly designed and I've never once used it.
  - Throwing an `AbstractError` is a much better solution.

## [1.21.0] - 2024-04-04
### Changed
- `observable()` added `redefine` argument.
- `observable()` added `opts.reinherit` option.
- `observable:${addre}()` added `inherit` argument.

### Added
- `observable`:
  - Added `opts.wrapsetup` to allow setup functions on event wrapper objects.
  - Added `opts.wraplock` to make locking the wrapper object configurable.

  - Added `lazyArgs` positional argument to `val()` and `get()` functions.
  - A new `Opts` class for handling multiple sources of options.
- `map`: A new library for functions related to `Map` objects.

- `core.arrays.List` class to abstract different types of lists.
### Changed
- `core.arrays.{containsAny,containsAll,removeItems}` use the new `List` class.

- Made the `core.context` more robust.
  - Greatly expanded Node.js detection with new `Node` property.
  - Added a new `Electron` property for detection of Electron.js environments.
  - Minor tweaks to other properties for more completion and accuracy.

## [1.13.0] - 2023-05-12

## [1.12.1] - 2023-02-11
### Fixed
- Dependency issues in `clone` and `lock` due to the previous `Enum` changes.
- The `lazy()` function now returns the target, like the docs said it did. 

## [1.12.0] - 2023-02-02
### Changed
- Enhanced the `Enum` generator.
  - The `opts.counter` is always used regardless of `opts.flags`.
  - If `opts.open` is `true`, that will overrule `opts.lock` now.
  - If `opts.lock` is not a valid value, a `TypeError` will be thrown.

### Changed
- The `core.context` vars have been changed quite a bit.

- Changed `test.output()` to `test.done()` in all tests.
### Added
- New `core.types.console` simple helper object.

## [1.8.2] - 2023-01-06
### Changed
- How the objectid and meta properties are exported to `core`.

## [1.8.1] - 2023-01-06
### Fixed
- Debugging line left in accidently.

## [1.8.0] - 2023-01-06
### Changed
- MAJOR CHANGE: After making everything use ModuleBuilder, I'm deprecating it.
  - It's cool in theory, but doesn't translate well when using webpack, etc.
  - It also locks the libraries into using CommonJS, which I don't want to do.
  - I've moved it into the `@lumjs/compat/modulebuilder` namespace.
  - A `@lumjs/compat/modulebuilder/into-core` helper can add it back to `core`.
- I removed the `core.modules` lazy property.
  - Use `require('@lumjs/core/modules')` to load that library explicitly.
  - This will be the path going forward for any code that is node.js specific.
### Added
- A new descriptor template builder. To be documented soon.
### Fixed
- Added some missing reference links to this changelog.

## [1.7.1] - 2022-10-18
### Fixed
- Corrected some DocBlocks that hadn't been updated.
### Changed
- Made *locale* functionality in `ModuleBuilder` simpler.
- Added some shortcuts for defining module names in `ModuleBuilder`.

## [1.7.0] - 2022-10-17
### Changed

- Added `core.newBuilder()` shortcut function that calls `core.ModuleBuilder.new()`.
- Added `core.obj.duplicateOne()` and `core.obj.duplicateAll()` functions,
  also available as `core.obj.copyAll.clone` and `core.obj.copyAll.duplicate`.
- ModuleBuilder uses `duplicateOne` instead of its own cheap `clone` function.
- Added `ModuleBuilder#set` method as a direct `core.def()` wrapper.
- Added `set()` wrapper to `ModuleBuilder.build()` output.
- ModuleBuilder detects accessor-style descriptors and doesn't try wrapping them.
- Significant refactoring of `core/obj/copyprops` module.
  - Fixed several options that weren't handled correctly.
  - Added a new `recursive` mode that can recursively merge nested objects.
  - Added a new `CopyProps` class for calling `copyProps()` with more than one
    source or target object using a declarative syntax.
- Rewrote `core/obj/merge.mergeNested()` method entirely.
  The new version simply wraps the recursive mode of `copyProps()`.
- Gave `needObj()` a secondary API where the `allowFunc` argument is skipped.

## [1.6.1] - 2022-10-13
### Added
- A `core.buildModule()` wrapper function that calls `core.ModuleBuilder.build()`.
### Fixed
- DocBlock with wrong property name.
- Changelog version pointers.

## [1.6.0] - 2022-10-13
### Added
- New `ModuleBuilder` class for defining modules in a really lazy way.
### Changed
- Made `core.obj` and `core.Enum` into lazy-loading properties.
- Made `core` use the new `ModuleBuilder` for defining its properties.

## [1.5.2] - 2022-10-05
### Changed
- Added separate `.npmignore` file.

## [1.5.1] - 2022-09-29
### Changed
- Removed `constructor()` from `AbstractClass`.
- Added `$needs()` to `AbstractClass`.
### Fixed
- `AbstractClass` actually works properly now.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-09-27
### Changed
- Updated a few DocBlocks.
- Added a couple explicitly named options to `def()`
- Rewrote the default module to use `def()` to define its exported properties.
- Made `arrays`, `strings`, `flags`, `opt`, `modules`, and `observable` use `lazy()`.
### Fixed
- Fixed `def()` so that the descriptor defaults are applied properly.
- Fixed `lazy()` so it returns a proper value and not a descriptor on first access.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-26
### Changed
- Moved `lazy` into `types` module by default (leaving an alias in `core`).
- Completely rewrote the `lazy` function entirely.
- Greatly extended the documentation for `lazy` function.
- Removed an unused development artefact from `types.needs`.

## [1.3.1] - 2022-09-23
### Fixed
- The `arrays` module exports `powerset` and `random` as it should.
- Recursive dependency order issues with `clone`, `lock`, and `enum` resolved.
- Custom `lock` options in `enum` module actually work now.
### Changed
- The `Enum()` function now has `configurable` and `enumerable` options.
- The `configurable` property in `enums` defaults to `false` now.
- Tweaked the *changelogs* a bit and added a new [changelog listing](index.md).

## [1.3.0] - 2022-09-11
### Changed
- Overhauled the `obj.clone()` method.
- Added *named options* for all of the behaviours that the `CLONE` *modes* affect.
  While this technically could make the *modes* obsolete, I'm leaving them in as
  simple sets of default options that can be used instead of manually choosing all
  of the individual options.
- Added a new `CLONE.N` *mode* which has **no** options turned on.
  It will always remain first in the *enum* list so it's value will always be `0`.
- Added the ability to clone properties using their descriptors.
  It is enabled by default on most of the *modes* now, as it simply makes sense.
- Added the ability to set the `prototype` on the cloned object.
- The `opts` parameter of `clone()` may be a `CLONE.*` enum value.
  It's a shortcut for `{mode: CLONE.MODE}` for convenience.
- A small tweak to `obj.copyProps()`, not important, just a cleanup.
### Fixed
- A reference in the DocBlock for `obj.getProperty()`.

## [1.2.1] - 2022-09-05
### Added
- `core.InternalObjectId#untag()`
### Changed
- Cleaned up the wording in a docblock, and updated a test to use `done()`.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-08-10
### Added
- Moved the `array.powerset()` and `array.random()` methods from Lum.js v4 into `core.arrays`.
- Added a new `core.context.isCommonJS()` method which is only used in certain circumstances.

### Fixed 
- A typo in one of the `package.json` exports.
- Commented out a debugging line.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-08-02
### Fixed
- A couple missing constants in some functions.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-07-29
### Added
- `types.doesDescriptorTemplate()` method.
- `obj.getProperty()` method (used to be in the `descriptors` sub-module.)
### Changed
- Tweaked documentation for:
  - `obj.getObjectPath()`
  - `obj.setObjectPath()`
  - `obj.getNamespace()`
  - `obj.setNamespace()`
- Updated error messages in `obj.setObjectPath()`
- Made `obj.setObjectPath()` use `types.doesDescriptorTemplate()` for validation of `opts.desc` option.
- Changed `obj.getObjectPath()` and `obj.setObjectPath()` to support `function` parent objects.
- Enhanced `types.stringify()` to support `RegExp` as well as supporting custom extensions down the road.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-07-27
### Changed
- Initial *stable* release.
- See [1.0-beta.md](1.0-beta.md) for the beta versions of `1.0`
- See [lum.js](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.js) for the original library set this is replacing.
