# Changelogs

All notable changes to this project will be documented in these files.

## Versions

To avoid the changelogs getting too big, I'm planning on splitting them up based
on the major version changes.

Each major version will be listed here in reverse chronological order (newest first.)

- [2.x](2.x.md) → The next upcoming major release.
- [1.x](1.x.md) → The first standalone core library.
- [1.0-beta.x](1.0-beta.md)
  → The *pre-releases* from when this split off of the older 
  [Lum.js](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.js) library collection.
